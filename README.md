```

## Code Overview

### Image Segmentation Using U-Net
This section describes the `Image_Segmentation_Using_U_net.ipynb` file.

- **Purpose**: Provides a U-Net based model for image segmentation.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Resizing and normalizing images and masks.
  - **Model Architecture**: U-Net with convolutional layers and dropout.
  - **Training**: Model fitting with early stopping and TensorBoard callbacks.
  - **Prediction**: Image segmentation results for training, validation, and test sets.

### Image Segmentation ML
This section describes the `Image_Segmentation_ML.ipynb` file.

- **Purpose**: Uses traditional machine learning methods for image segmentation.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Feature extraction using various edge detection and filtering methods.
  - **Model Training**: Random Forest Classifier for segmentation.
  - **Evaluation**: Model accuracy and feature importance.

### Image Denoising
This section describes the `Image_Denoising_.ipynb` file.

- **Purpose**: Implements an autoencoder for image denoising.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Data Preparation**: Adding noise to images and preprocessing.
  - **Model Architecture**: Autoencoder with convolutional layers.
  - **Training**: Training the autoencoder on noisy images.
  - **Validation**: Evaluating denoising performance on validation data.

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
